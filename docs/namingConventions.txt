Project: Contacts - Contact management application for job hunting.

This document provides some thoughts and guidelines on the naming of classes, 
variables, tables, etc. in the Contacts application. 

Words should be used in a consistent and unambiguous way throughout the 
application. Words can have multiple meanings; concepts can be expressed 
by several different words. The goal is not to find the best possible word 
for a given concept, but rather to find a good word and use it consistently.

The chosen words need not align with the app's gui wording, but they can.

==================================================

Some basic rules -
    Java classes, variables, constants should follow the usual conventions.
        e.g. UpperCamelCase, lowerCamelCase, ALL_UPPER respectively.
    Database tables & columns should generally follow Java class & variable 
        conventions, e.g. UpperCamelCase.lowerCamelCase
    Database association tables should use table1_table2 format.
    Names should be meaningful
    Names should not be too long 
    Abbreviations should generally be avoided.
    When using abbreviations or acronyms, treat them like words 
        e.g. WbezNpr rather than WBEZNPR
