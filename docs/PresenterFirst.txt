The following descriptions of the steps of the Presenter-First pattern/process comes from:

=========================================

A strength of Presenter First is the simple, concrete nature of the approach. 
Development proceeds as follows:

1. Create a stub presenter class that takes a model interface and a view 
   interface in its constructor

2. Create mock test objects that satisfy the model and view interfaces

3. For all user stories

    3.1. Select a prioritized user story

    3.2. Analyze story for impact on view

    3.3. Add support to view interface for the story

    3.4. Analyze story for impact on model

    3.5. Add support to model interface for the story

    3.6. Implement methods in the mock objects for the new 
         interface methods which confirm they were called, 
         or which return typical data

    3.7. For all things that can break (TDD loop)
        3.7.1 Do for each test
            3.7.1.1. Write a test for the presenter that exercises the app via an event 
                     or action on the view or model (an external system event)
            3.7.1.2 Make assertions on the state of the model and the state of the view
            3.7.1.3 Implement private methods in presenter Until the test passes

    3.8. Create a minimal user interface implementation to satisfy the view 
         interface for this story
